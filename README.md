# E-commerce-Object-Detection

Used Transfer learning using imageai with YOLOv3 and Retinanet to detect daily life e-commerce objects without any training data.
Weights I used can be downloaded from imageai website.
In last script uses google-spellcheck which is a script based on 'Did you mean' of google to correct misspelled words.

### Todo
1. Increase accuracy.
2. Make script to scrape object's prices from web.
